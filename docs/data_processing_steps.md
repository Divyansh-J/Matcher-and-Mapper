# Data Processing Workflow - ETIM to LOV Matching (Revised Approach)

## Overview
This workflow matches ETIM 9.0 records with LOV (List of Values) data using a comprehensive 3-point matching system. ETIM has fewer records, making it the optimal starting point.

## Step 1: ETIM-First Matching Strategy
1. **Start with ETIM Records**: Extract each record from ETIM 9.0 database (smaller dataset)
2. **Match Against LOV**: For each ETIM record, search for matches in LOV unique values
3. **Extract on Match**: When a match is found, extract the corresponding class codes from ETIM

## Step 2: Multi-Point Matching System
For each ETIM record, perform matching on three key attributes:
1. **Class/Name Matching**: Match ETIM class names with LOV ICC names
2. **Feature Matching**: Match ETIM features with LOV feature attributes  
3. **Value Matching**: Match ETIM values with LOV value attributes

### Matching Criteria:
- **Complete Match**: All 3 attributes must match for a confirmed match
- **Partial Match**: Flag records with 1-2 matches for review

## Step 3: Advanced Matching Techniques
For records that don't achieve complete matches:
1. **Fuzzy Matching**: Apply fuzzy string matching algorithms
   - Handle typos, variations, and abbreviations
   - Set similarity threshold (e.g., 85% match)
2. **Sequence Matching**: Use sequence-based matching for ordered data
   - Handle cases where attribute order might vary

## Step 4: Output Generation
1. **Complete Matches**: Generate target records for all 3-point matches
2. **Fuzzy Matches**: Include fuzzy/sequence matches with confidence scores
3. **Unmatched Records**: Flag ETIM records with no LOV matches for manual review

## Expected Output Structure
```
Target File Columns:
- etim_class_id: Original ETIM class identifier
- etim_class_name: ETIM class/feature name
- etim_feature: ETIM feature attribute
- etim_value: ETIM value attribute
- lov_icc_name: Matched LOV ICC name
- match_type: Complete/Fuzzy/Sequence/Manual
- confidence_score: Matching confidence (0-100%)
- class_code: Final assigned class code
```

## Matching Strategy Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Start with smaller ETIM dataset (fewer iterations)
- **Comprehensive**: 3-point matching ensures accuracy
- **Flexible**: Fuzzy and sequence matching catch edge cases
- **Quality**: Clear confidence scoring for validation

## Quality Assurance
- Track match types and confidence scores
- Manual review queue for low-confidence matches
- Validation reports showing match distribution
- Exception handling for unmatched records
